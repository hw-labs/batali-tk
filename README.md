# Batali TK

Batali for test-kitchen!

## Usage

Batali support must be injected into test-kitchen. This is done by using
a wrapper command. Instead of calling kitchen directly:

```
$ kitchen --help
```

use the wrapper command:

```
$ batali-tk --help
```

This will hopefully not be needed for future versions of test kitchen.
